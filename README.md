Python API Challenge

For this project there were two parts.  
The first part was to use python requests and api's and to use visuals to show what the weather is like as you get closer to the equator.  Also determined a number of factors (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed).
The second part of the project was to use python and geoapify API to determinde coordinates, city, humidity, country and hotels and to create a map visualization for all.
